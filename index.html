          University of Lagos studying Systems Engineering. I am particularly
          interested in Frontend Engineering, anything Data and Artificial
          Intelligence.When I am not learning to code, I am watching my favorite
          basketball team, Golden State Warriors, watching a YouTube video,
          learning Spanish on Duolingo or learning something new.
